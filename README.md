mox_tools v0.1 alpha
====================

*CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT.*

A JavaScript based toolset to help aid in the development of responsive/adaptive web sites, that also comes bundled with the mox theme boilerplate.

Currently it supports updated sizes on regions that you can define in debug.js, and a window size, that updates as you resize the browser window.

You can change the wrapper divs, that individual sizes are calculated from, or the different key bindings in the options variable.

* Key '1': Overall window size (media query).
* Key '2': Size on different regions (Handy if you want the size on the sidebar, at any given moment.

Roadmap:

* Adaptable grid support.
